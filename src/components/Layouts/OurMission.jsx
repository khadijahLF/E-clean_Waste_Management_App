          <p>
            At EClean, we are on a mission to revolutionize waste 
            management practices across Africa. We believe that every 
            piece of waste holds the potential for transformation, not 
            just in terms of environmental sustainability but also as a 
            source of economic opportunity. We aim to bridge the gap 
            between waste generators and recyclers, creating a seamless 
            platform where responsible disposal leads to tangible rewards
