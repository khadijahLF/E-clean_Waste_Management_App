                At EClean, we are on a mission to revolutionize waste management
                practices across Africa. We believe that every piece of waste
                holds the potential for transformation, not just in terms of
                environmental sustainability but also as a source of economic
                opportunity. We aim to bridge the gap between waste generators
                and recyclers, creating a seamless platform where responsible
                disposal leads to tangible rewards
