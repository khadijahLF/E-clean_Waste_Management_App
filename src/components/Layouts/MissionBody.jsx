        <h3>Why we exist</h3>
        <br />
        <p>Africa is facing a staggering challenge in terms of environmental pollution and inadequate waste management. Every year, an estimated 174 million tons of waste is generated across the continent, with only about 10-15% being collected and properly disposed of. This leaves a significant portion of waste unmanaged, leading to severe consequences for our environment and communities.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Improper waste disposal not only pollutes our land and water but also poses serious health risks to our populations. In fact, it's estimated that over 200,000 premature deaths occur annually in Africa due to diseases related to poor sanitation and waste management. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for change.</p>
        <br />
        <p>At EClean, we are driven by the staggering statistics and the real impact they have on our environment and people. We exist to confront these challenges head-on and pave the way for a cleaner, healthier future for Africa.</p>
